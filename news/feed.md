## Finally returning after I've completed the Training Arc

### 2024_07_09

It has been roughly **3 month without any updates** of the source code.

The software and hardware were once again getting in my way.
I hit a plateau, where I was to slow to accomplish anything significant on any project 🥹

Things couldn't remain as they are or I would'nt **be able to keep up in the FOSS world**.
I went on **a journey to master tools** that I hope would help me get the work done. 🧐

Here is a non exhaustive list.

- Nixos
- Fish with a lot of plugins and alias (Atuin)
- Neovim (Nvchad heavily customed)
- Hyprland (heavily customed)
- A split mechanical otholinear ergonomic keyboard (to learn touchtyping)

After a lot of struggle and slang words, it is finally **successfully DONE.**

I am **now back on track and faster than ever** in everything I do.

Let's keep pushin'! 😈

# What is up? Where i have been!

As you are more and more to use pipelight
I owe you updates on where the software is heading to.

It has been roughly 3 month without any updates of the source code.

## The harsh truth

I just couldn't keep up with feature requests and bug patches.

Software side I had a neovim configuration falling appart,
was using a clunky desktop environment,
a terminal and a shell that would have give you nightmare.
(a nude bash on xterm was almost better)
I felt like the machine was working against me. It came in my way everytime I had to
work.

The hardware was a suffering too.
Back pain and elbow pain caused by a bad position on a 60% keyboard.
eyes tearing because I've never learned how to touchtype.

Something was off.

Although It was the best set-up/configuration I ever had, I had just hit a plateau.

Every line of code was becoming painful.
I had to completly rething how I code.

## Training Arc

First month.

I went on a periple to master:

- Nixos
- Fish with a lot of plugins
- Nvim
- Hyprland
- A split mechanical otholinear ergonomic keyboard (touchtype)

A complet rebrand of my PC to bend the metal to my will as fast as possible.

DONE.

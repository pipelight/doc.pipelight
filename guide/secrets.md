# Secrets storage

Pipelight doesn't come with a secret/vault plugin.
You can use whatever you want to store crucial information.

However here is a first aid kit for secret storage.

## User rights (default)

The **first level of security** is provided by Linux access rights and user privileges.
To ensure a first guard, you may want to **run pipelines as a specific user with dedicated rights** on needed files.

### Running process environment

Commands can directly use the user environment.

Bash commands are run in a separate spawned process running in the background,
but this process still has acces to the user environment.
It benefits the same environment as when you run a command in your terminal,
allowing you to use every of your local configurations files and environment variables.

For example, for ssh, no need to set every arguments on a single command.

```sh
ssh [user]@[ip] -i [./ssh_secrets/id_rsa] -F [./my_config_file]
```

The subprocess has access to the user's local configurations and aliases (/etc/hosts, .ssh/config).
The command can therefore be shortened.

```sh
ssh [server_name]
```

Resulting in a more readable pipeline.

```ts
//pipelight.ts
const steps = [
  {
    name: "build",
    commands: ["ssh server"]
  }
];
```

## Dotenv files

It is pretty common to store secrets in `.env` files (dotenv).

```sh
# .env
PORT=8081
USER_NAME=default
USER_PASSWORD=secret
```

Load the `.env` file and use your variables as you wish.

```ts
// pipelight.ts
import { load } from "https://deno.land/std/dotenv/mod.ts";
const env = await load();
const password = env.USER_PASSWORD;
```

You can create multiple dotenv for different environments
like nightly, test and production and load them on the matching cases.
See the use [environment variables](/guide/tips/environments) section,
and go further with the [Deno documentation](https://deno.land/manual/basics/env_variables).

## Third party vaults

You can still store your secrets in your favorite dedicated third-party software
and make an API call to the Vault from your `pipelight.ts` file.

If you seak to plug your vault more simply, [Novops](https://pierrebeucher.github.io/novops/intro.html) is the way to go.

## Novops - The allmighty Vault aggregator. <Badge type="warning" text="beta" />

::: danger Not tested

The tests concerning novops integration havn't been written yet.

### Install

#### Arch Linux

Install from the AUR

```sh
paru -S novops-git
```

#### Other distros

Get distro specific instructions on [Novops](https://pierrebeucher.github.io/novops/install.html)
official documentation.

### Usage

Using the vault aggregator [Novops](https://pierrebeucher.github.io/novops/install.html)
you can bridge your every password managers to pipelight pretty easily.

First define a unique env file `novops.yml`

```yml
# .novops.yml
environments:
  dev:
    # Environment variables for dev environment
    variables:
      # Fetch Hashicorp Vault secrets
      - name: DATABASE_PASSWORD
        value:
          hvault_kv2:
            path: crafteo/app/dev
            key: db_password
      # Plain string are also supported
      - name: DATABASE_USER
        value: root

    # Generate temporary AWS credentials for IAM Role
    # Provide environment variables:
    # - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    # - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    # - AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
    aws:
      assume_role:
        role_arn: arn:aws:iam::12345678910:role/dev_deploy
```

Then load every secrets as shell environnment variables

```sh
novops load

```

Now coupling it with Pipelight.

::: code-group

```ts
const my_pipeline = {
  name: "test",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "provide environnment",
      commands: ["novops run -- <my_command>"]
    }
  ]
};
```

```ts [ts(with helpers)]
const my_pipeline = pipeline("test", () => [
  step("provide environnment", () => [
    // Provide your commands with the novops env vars
    novops(() => [...my_commands])
  ])
]);
```
